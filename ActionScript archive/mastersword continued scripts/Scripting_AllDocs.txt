Parameter Info:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[thothie][/thothie] = Entry added by Thothie based on working script or code

<command> - Means the parameter is required
[command] - Means the parameter is optional
(target) - indicates origin is to be used instead of entity id
_idx - indicates client model index rather than entity id

(r,g,b) is a color in the format "(red,green,blue)".  Each value ranges from 0-255 //thothie - with the exception of some client side effects, including beams, which are 0-1.0

$rand(<low>,<high>) 
$randf(<low>,<high>) 
	Returns a random number bewtween <low> and <high>.  Floating point uses $randf()
$vec(x,y,z) 
	Returns (x,y,z), with all parameters resolved (you can use constants or variables for x, y and z)
$vec.<x/y/z/pitch/yaw/roll>(<vector>) 
	Returns the x, y, z, pitch, yaw or roll value of the specified vector
	pitch, yaw and roll correspond to x, y and z respectively, but are named for clarity
$anglediff(<destang>,<srcang>) 
	Returns the difference between two angles.  Accounts for 360 degree wrap-around
$relpos(r,f,u) 
	Is a relative position in the format "$relPos(units Right,units Forward,units Up)"
	For example, $relpos(-1,10,0) Means 1 unit to the left (negative), 10 units forward,
 	and 0 units up from the origin of the item or NPC that is running the script command.

$relpos($vec(pitch,yaw,roll),$vec(r,f,u)) 
	Returns a relative position, same as the above command, except you specify the source
	angles instead of using the entity's angles.  A string such as,
	"$relpos((0,90,0),(60,60,10))"
	will *not* work.  You must use $vec(), such as "$relpos($vec(0,90,0),$vec(60,60,10))"
	Or use variables, such as "$relpos(ANGLES_VAR,OFFSET_VAR)"

$relvel(r,f,u) 
	Is a relative velocity in a similar format to $relpos()
	For example, $relvel(-1,10,0) Means 1 unit to the left (negative), 10 units forward,
 	and 0 units up based on the direction the item or NPC is facing

$relvel($vec(pitch,yaw,roll),$vec(r,f,u)) 
	Returns a relative velocity, same as the above command, except the source angles
	are specified instead of using the entity's angles.  Syntax rules are similar to $relpos

$cansee(<enttype>,[distance]) 
	Returns 1 if the monster can see <enttype> or 0 if not.  When [distance]
	is specified, the target must be within this distance to be successful.  
	<enttype> may be "enemy", "ally", "player", or a monster or player name.
	//note $cansee(enemy) doesn't conform to relations used by $get(ent_lastheard,relation,ent_me) etc.

$dist(<start origin>,<end origin>) 
	Returns a float indicating the distance between the two points

$veclen(<vector>) 
	Returns the length of a vector

$veclen2D(<vector>)

$within_cone2D(<point origin>,<cone origin>,<cone angles>,<cone apex angle>) 
	Returns 1 if the point is within the defined infinite cone

$cone_dot(<point origin>,<cone origin>,<cone angles>) 
$cone_dot2D(<point origin>,<cone origin>,<cone angles>) 
	Returns -1 to 1 indicating how far off the point is from straight forward in the view cone

$anim_exists(<name>)
	Checks if anim <name> exists within the scripted monster or player.

	Returns the sky height at <origin>.  Returns "none" if sky not found or if <origin> 
	is above the sky
$get_ground_height(<origin>)
	Returns the ground height at <origin>.  Returns "none" if ground not found or if <origin> 
	is below the ground

$get_skill_ratio(<ratio(0-1)>,<Min Amt>,<Max Amt>)
	Returns a number between Min and Max based on the ratio. If the ratio is .5, this returns
	a number halfway between Min and Max.  If .1, the number is 10% of the way towards Max.

$int(<number>) 
	Returns <number> as an integer
$float(<precision>,<number>) 
	Returns <number> as a float with <precision> decimal places
$stradd(<string1>,<string2>,<string3>,etc.)
	Adds strings together //Thothie - never seen this work, but the code looks fine :\
$get_token(<token string>,<idx>)

playrandomsound <channel #> <volume> [sound1] [sound2] [sound3] [none] etc..
	Plays a random sound between sound1, sound2, sound3... (Any may be ommited, or replaced with 'none').
	# sets the channel the sound plays on.

sound.setvolume <channel #> <sound> <volume>
	Changes the volume of an already playing sound
say <sound>[length] [sound][length] [sound][length] etc..

	Example: say chitchat[.5]
	This would play sound/npc/chitchat.wav and open the NPC's mouth for .5 seconds

	Example: say iam[.5] [.5] fine[.7]
	This would play sound/npc/iam.wav and open the NPC's mouth for .5 seconds.  After .5 seconds, the
	NPC would open his mouth again for another .5 seconds (Assuming the wav file contained the words
	"I am", this would simulate the NPC mouthing the words).  Then the sound sound/npc/fine.wav is played
	and the mouth opened for .7 seconds.

callevent [delay] <eventname> [PARAM1] [PARAM2] etc...
	Executes the named event after [delay] seconds (optional)
	Can pass parameters to the event
	[thothie]Note: you cannot use PARAMs if you use a delay, pass with setvard instead
		Also note you cannot pass PARAMs or keywords directly from one scriptevent to another
		for instance:
		callevent do_stuff PARAM1 PARAM2 ent_me
		is invalid, the event will recieve the literal strings ("PARAM1", "ent_me", etc.) instead of a variable
		instead use:
		local OUT_PARAM1 PARAM1
		local OUT_PARAM2 PARAM2
		callevent do_stuff OUT_PARAM1 OUT_PARAM2 $get(ent_me,id)
		this applys whenever you send a param or substution to another script or event
		be it via callevent, callexternal, applyeffect, createnpc, or what not
	[/thothie]
callexternal <target> [delay] <eventname> [PARAM1] [PARAM2] etc...
	Executes the script event <eventname> on <target> after [delay] seconds (server side only)

callexternal all <eventname> [PARAM1] [PARAM2] etc...
	Calls the script event on every existing player, npc, and item in the game.
	//thothie - you can use "players" in place of all, to only call the script event on players

calleventloop <loops> <eventname> [PARAM1] [PARAM2] etc...
	Executes the script event <eventname> <loops> times in a row
	Can pass parameters to the event
	Recieving event gets game.script.iteration to count loops (count starts at 0)
dodamage <target> <range> <dmg> <cth> [type]
	Causes monster to attack <target> up to a distance of <range> for damage <dmg> at 
	a chance to hit of <cth> (in %)
dodamage <target> "direct" <dmg> <cth> <dmg source> [type]
	Causes direct damage to be dealt, without range checking.  <dmg source> is the attacker
dodamage <position> <range> <dmg> <cth> <attn> <flags> [type]
	Does radius damage at <position> with <range>, <cth> and falloff <attn>.
	<attn> == 1.0 Means linear falloff | 0.0 is no damage falloff with ranage.
        Higher <attn> values make damage falloff faster
	Flags:
		"reflective": Can damage yourself
		"normal": Cannot damage self
	[type] = damage type (eg. slash, pierce, blunt, fire, lightning, cold, poison, etc.) - defaults to "generic" //New as of JAN2007

[Thothie]
AOE damage (the third type) seems to have some sort of bug where it needs to be near (or maybe LOS) of the calling script
Using xdodamage may prevent this issue (see ms.stx)

related events (called whithin the attacking monsters script when he does damage to a target): 
{ game_dodamage //1:AttackHit(1/0)  2:EntityHit  3:StartOrigin  4:EndOrigin
{ game_damaged_other //PARAM1=ent hit PARAM2=damage
{ game_struck //PARAM1=incoming damage
{ game_damaged //PARAM1=attacker PARAM2=Damage PARAM3=DamageType

	transitions. The npc's ent_owner is set to the player.
	'remove' - removes the companion from the player.
	//Thothie - Defunct, companions use quest data for better dependability / less character corruption
emitsound <source entity> <origin> <volume> <duration> <type> [danger radius (only for "danger")]
	Creates a sound that monsters can respond to.
	<type> Can be:
		"danger": Monsters should avoid <origin> up to [danger radius] units
		"combat": A combat action has been initiated by  <source entity>
		"move": <source entity> is moving
	<volume> Acts as the radius for the sound.  However this radius will be multiplied
	for npcs that have hearingsensitivity set higher than 1.  They will hear further.
	When an NPC hears a sound (hearingsensitivity taken into account), the event
	game_hearsound is called with:
		ent_lastheard: Source Entity
		PARAM1 - Sound type
		PARAM2 - Sound Origin
		PARAM3 - Danger Radius (If danger sound)
helptip <target> <tipname> <title> <text>
	Displays a help tip on the player's screen, if it hasn't already been displayed.
	Use a bar (|) as a carriage return.
	//Thothie - tipname 'generic' is repeatable
quest set <target> <questname> <questdata>
	Sets the data of a quest for <target> player.  This is saved to the player's file.
quest unset <target> <questname>
	Removes the data of a quest for <target> player.  This is saved to the player's file.
usetrigger <trigger1> [trigger2] [trigger3] etc..
	Fires map triggers named <trigger1>, [trigger2], etc..
saytext <speech>
	Causes the monster to say <speech>

	Changes the range of <saytext>.  "Default" sets it back to the game default (300)
givehp <amount>
givemp <amount>

storage
  <openaccount> <storagename> <target> <callback>
	Opens a storage account in storage <storagename> for <target>
	Calls "<callback>_exists" if account already exists
	Calls "<callback>_success" if successful
  <checkaccount> <storagename> <target> <callback>
	Checks if <target> owns an account in storage <storagename>
	Calls "<callback>_success" if successful
	Calls "<callback>_failed" if failed
  <trade> <storagename> <target> <feeratio> <displayname> <callback>
	Gives <target> access to storage <storagename>
	Retrieval will cost the item price times <feeratio>
	Calls "<callback>_noaccount" if player has no account
	Calls "<callback>_success" if successful
//Thothie - all "storage" commands are defunct- this method of banking corrupts characters

VAR TYPES:	
const <var> <val>
	Replaces all subsequent instances of <var> with <val>
	const is only executed at loadtime
	A const can only be defined once.  All subsequent definitions are ignored
	[Thothie]
	Use this for any static value
	Only subsequent "const" definitions are ignored - setvar and setvard's are not
	Redefining a const as a setvar/d causes strange and unpredictable behavior
	[/Thohie]
local <var> <val>
	Sets an event variable <var> to now be equal to <val>
	These variables are local to the event, and deleted at the end of the event
	[thothie]
	Use this whenever the var is not needed outside of an event, such as with one-time calculations and adjustments
	These may static in calleventloop's - I've not tested
	[/thothie]
setvar <var> <val>
	Sets a script variable <var> to now be equal to <val>
	setvar is executed at loadtime and runtime
	[thothie]
	This should ONLY be used if the var MUST be defined pre-spawn AND is adjusted later (ie. almost never)
	if the setvar is defined ANYWHERE else in the script, it will pick up the subsequent definition prior to script processing
	since such behavior is difficult to predict, it is best to avoid use of these when possible
	[/thothie]
setvarg <var> <val>
	Sets a global variable <var> to now be equal to <val>
	setvarg is only executed at runtime.
	[thothie]
	These stay after map transitions, but not server crashes - they are not always 100% dependable
	Convention says all setvarg's should start with "G_"
	You can *usually* use these whenever a bunch of different npcs need to share a count
	You cannot use this to pass var from server to client or visa versa (setvarg's are server side)
	[/thothie]
setvard <var> <val>
	Sets a script variable <var> to now be equal to <val>
	setvard is only executed at runtime.
	[thothie]
	Most variables should use this function
	Do not use this to change a setvar or const or strange things will happen
	[/thothie]
//Thothie
- Try not to mix and match var types - especially via #include - I've not yet discovered the paticulars, but it can result in unpredictable behavior
- such as vars not getting set, or even swapping positions with other vars
- suspect something in the code needs to be fixed in this regards
- Note that anything in game_spawn or npc_spawn is pre-loaded
- thus vars used to define things there (such as setanimidle or setmodel) must be setvar or const
- to avoid confusion, define as little as possible there (just the model) and use use npc_post_spawn to define the rest
- script specific:
- ANIM_IDLE should always be a setvar (often loaded in game_spawn, thus is preload))
- ANIM_RUN should always be a setvar (often loaded in game_spawn, thus is preload))
- ANIM_WALK should always be a setvar (often loaded in game_spawn, thus is preload)
- All other vars used by base_monster_xxx should be always setvard instead (ATTACK_RANGE, MOVE_RANGE, etc.)

        <type> can be any valid ent type. Manually storing some types (such as ent_owner, ent_lastheard)
               may interfere what the game expects to be stored in that slot and cause a crash
deleteent <target> ["fade"]

		"worldonly"		Only hit the world
		"ignoreglass" 		Goes through glass (Can be combined with other flags)
		"simplebox" 		Uses bounding boxes instead of hitboxes (Can be combined with other flags)
		
	The result is stored in the following variables:

	game.trace.hit		[0/1] Whether the trace hit anything.
	game.trace.fraction	[0-1] Ratio of how far the trace traveled before a collision
	game.trace.hitent	Server: id of entity hit.  |  Client: index of entity hit | or "none" if hit wall

	[scope]  == Optional scope.  Can be [client] or [server]
	[casual] == Doesn't error if file not found

#scope <scope>
	Sets the default event scope [server/client/shared]
	Events found after this line will use this scope if one isn't explicitly set

	Executed at loadtime
precachefile <scriptname>
	Precaches the models, sprites and sounds used in the specified script

		   "[itemname]:[amt] - Payment will cost [amt] items named [itemname]
				x.data can consist of multiple payments, separated by a semicolon
				Ex: "local reg.mitem.data gold:10;skins_ratpelt:3;item_torch"
				(This payment requires 10 gold, 3 rat pelts, and one torch)
				If payment succeeds, x.callback is called.   If player is can't pay, x.cb_failed is called.
		"payment_silent" - Same as payment, except if you don't have all the items/gold,
				   the game won't tell you what you're missing.
				   [Thothie - This crashes if the player gives the NPC the wrong item! Don't use it, rather use $item_exists() to verify the item exists before displaying the menu option]
		"disabled"	- Show the item as disabled 
				//Thothie - beware sometimes disabled
				//menu items can still be selected via keystrokes
		"itemdesc"	- Displays active item description
		"forgive"	- Uses "forgive" command

	"reg.mitem.data"	- Custom data, used differently depending on type
	"reg.mitem.callback"	- Event that is called if this option is chosen
	"reg.mitem.cb_failed"	- Event that is called if the action fails

menuitem.remove <ID>

	Removes an item from an NPC's menu.  Use the custom ID that was set when the 
	item was registered.

menu.open <target player>

	Opens the interact menu with the target player

menu.autoopen

	Opens the interact menu with any player that presses "+use" on the NPC
Master Sword uses a scripting system to control most interations.

There's a few different types of scripts, specialized for a purpose in the game.


NPCs
====================================================

NPC scripts are very generic.  It doesn't neccesarily have to be an npc.  These can
be thought of more as 'entity' scripts.  But for now, they're named NPC scripts.
An NPC script can create a monster that attacks, or it could be a rock that disappears
when destroyed, opening a secret passage.

- NPC scripts are re-loaded from file each time one is spawned
- When spawned..

  > Game calls: game_spawn

- When killed by player

  > Game calls: game_death
  > If the script doesn't use setalive to revive the NPC, then after this event
    repeatdelay events won't be called.  This effectively disables AI while the dead
    body sits.

------------------

Items
====================================================

Items scripts are treated differently than NPC scripts.

- Item scripts are loaded...
  > Once at startup, on client 
  > Each map load, on server
  > From items.txt (so the game knows what all the item scripts are at startup)
  > Preprocessing is done once for all items at load time, and never again.
    (Consts are replaced with their const value and the const commands deleted)
    (The script text format is converted to binary)
    (Whenever a new item is spawned, a copy of this 'pre-processed' version is used instead of reloading)

- When an item comes into existence

  > Game calls: game_spawn
  > This happens at various times.  Sometimes the item is spawned quickly just to grab some HUD
    info about it and then it's immediately deleted (especially during VGUI).  So you 
    can't assume much during an item spawn.  Set appropriate item values, but don't do any actions.

- When an item is picked up...

  > Game calls: game_pickup
  > Called anytime the player receives an item. The item may be placed into player hands, or
    straight into a pack.

- When an item becomes available for use...

  > Game calls: game_deploy
  > The item is now in player hands, ready to be used.  This is generally when the item is picked up 
    from the ground or removed from pack.

- When an item is dropped

  > Game calls: game_drop   (Only called when the player presses "drop")
  > Game calls: game_remove (This is called anytime the item is removed from player, even forcefully)

------------------

Effects
====================================================

- Effect scripts

Effect scripts are meant to modify other scripts.
For example, you might want the player to have a bash ability that stuns any NPC it hits.
The bash would be made into a an 'effect' script.  This script can be attached to any NPC 
and modify or override values of the NPCs.  In this case it would attach to the target of 
the bash attack, then override the framerate and movespeed, causing the NPC to attack and 
move slower.  Effect scripts can also be attached to players.


- Special Effect scripts

Any script can be run on either the server or client side.  The most common reason to run
a script client-side is for visual special effects (with no stress on the server).  You could 
have an NPC cast a spell serverside, then handle the spell effects client-side.  You can either
do this in the same NPC script or split the client and server tasks between scripts for 
organization.

However when a script is sent to the client, it ALWAYS attaches to the local player.  This is
fine for effects that change the player's movement or view, but sometimes the script needs to
affect entities other than the local player.

For example, if you want a fire sprite to continuously track an NPC (client-side), then you'd
transmit the NPC's index from the server script to the client script (SFX script).  The SFX
script can find the corresponding entity on the client, and create a fire sprite at the
entity's location each frame.

setwearpos <position name> <max slots>
	Adds or modifies a position for wearable items on a player. ("head","chest","waist", etc.)
setwearpos clearall
	Removes all the available positions for a player to wear items.
drainstamina <target player> <amount>
	Drains or Gives stamina
playermessage <target> <message>
	Sends a message to player's HUD.  Message words may be variables
	//thothie: you can also use rplayermessage, glayermessage, bplayermessageb, yplayermessagey, and //dplayermessage for red, green, blue, yellow, and gray hud messages, respectively (MAR2007)
consolemsg <target> <message>
	Sends a message to player's console.  Message words may be variables
infomsg <target/"all"> <title> <message>
	Sends a message to player's Info Window (top left fading window). //Thothie - vars must be pre-parsed (see player/player_main event game_learnskill for example)
respawn <target/"all">
	Moves the player to his respawn point.
setgaitspeed
	Sets the movement speed at which the legs (gait) anim fps should be played at 100% (normal speed)
	If the current speed varies from this movement speed, then the gait anim is played at a ratio.

//setprop <target> movetype entries discovered by code diving
// const.movetype.toss works but odd effects
// .walk crashes
// .push slides through wall based on relvel (maybe useful for spells)
// .bounce, well does what you'd expect (LOL) (may also be useful)
// .none does what you'd expect
// .pushstep acts similar to .toss
// .follow similar to toss
// .step standard movement

//======== ADDED BY THOTHIE
$get_map_valid(<target>)
- <target> must be player 
- returns 1 if player was at proper transition during map change

$get_lastmap(<target>) 
- <target> must be player 
- returns name of destmap from last trans (buggy sometimes, returns odd but consistant strings)

$get_jointype(<target>)
- <target> must be player 
- retrieves map join type: "Travel" | "Start Map" | "GM" | "Previously Visited" | "Not Allowed"


//newly discovered things

//This is npcmove format, used in magic_hand_summon_base

//**************************** NPCMOVE *****************************
command:
npcmove <target> <(destination)>

first register:
reg.npcmove.endpos <(X,y,z)> - guessing startpos is $relpos(0,0,0)
reg.npcmove.testonly (0|1) - don't actually do the move, just report result

returns:
game.ret.npcmove.success - 1|0
game.ret.npcmove.dist - distance moved (or would have moved)
game.ret.npcmove.hitstep - 1|0 (I guess weather or not NPC had to jump a step)

//**************************** SETENV *****************************

used by several weather scripts, affects all clients
setenv <prop> <value>
eg:
setenv sky.texture <string>
setenv lightgamma (<float-red>,<float-green>,<float-blue>)
setenv maxviewdist <distance>
setenv fog.enabled <1|0>
setenv fog.color (<float-red>,<float-green>,<float-blue>)
setenv fog.density <value>
setenv fog.start <distance from client>
setenv fog.end <distance from client?>
setenv fog.type <exp|exp2|linear> - only linear seems to be of any use
setenv screen.tint (<float-red>,<float-green>,<float-blue>)?(maybe a fourth alpha value, not sure)
by <float-red> etc, I mean these colors work on a float ramp, instead of color ramp (I guess 32-bit color)
meaning, (1.0,0.0,0.0) = pure red (1.0,0.0,1.0) = purple, (0.5,0.5,0.5) = grey, etc. etc.

//**************************** removescript *****************************

removescript is absolutely CRUICIAL to removing client side scripts
if no removescript is called when the client side effects end, the effect will effectively never go away

//**************************** $item_exists *****************************

$item_exists(<target>,<item_name>,[flags])
Rather critical for item menu interaction
Returns if player has an item in his inventory
* not sure if this works outside the scope of NPCs searching players
Valid flags are:
"nohands" - do not search hands
"noworn" - do not search worn items
"notinpack" - not in pack
"partialname" - search by partial item_name (eg. "armor_") //not sure if this works
"remove" - removes the item if found (new hack in the hard code by Thothie@JAN2007a)
"name" - returns the proper name of the item, if found (for storage system by Thothie@JAN2007a)

//**************************** $get_traceline(<start_origin>,<end_origin>,<flags>) *****************************

Added FEB2007
Traces a vector from start_origin to end_origin, returns strike result:

Flags are:
ent - Returns ent struck (returns vector end, if none struck)
worldonly - Returns end position or where traceline struck world object (wall, etc)


//************************** $get_insphere(<search_type>,<radius>,[source_origin]) ***************************
Added MAY2007a
<search_type> can be:
 player - returns nearest player id
 monster - returns nearest monster id
 any - returns nearest living MSC ent (either player or monster)
 <id> - returns 1 if sought id found

 if [source_origin] is omited, scan centers on calling script ent

getents <search_type> <radius>

//************************** getents <search_type> <radius> [source_origin] ***************************
Added MAY2007a
<search_type> can be:
 player - returns nearest player id
 monster - returns nearest monster id
 any - returns nearest living MSC ent (either player or monster)

Similar to $get_insphere but stores ents into an "array", as follows:
GET_COUNT - # of ents captured in scan
GET_COUNT1, GET_COUNT2, GET_COUNT3... GET_COUNT9 - stores first 9 found ID's

//useful related code sample (stun all enemies within 256 units)

{ stun_sphere
	getents any 256
	setvard LOOP_COUNT 0
	calleventloop GET_COUNT stun_insphere
}

{ stun_insphere
	add LOOP_COUNT 1
	if ( LOOP_COUNT == 1 ) local CHECK_ENT GET_ENT1
	if ( LOOP_COUNT == 2 ) local CHECK_ENT GET_ENT2
	if ( LOOP_COUNT == 3 ) local CHECK_ENT GET_ENT3
	if ( LOOP_COUNT == 4 ) local CHECK_ENT GET_ENT4
	if ( LOOP_COUNT == 5 ) local CHECK_ENT GET_ENT5
	if ( LOOP_COUNT == 6 ) local CHECK_ENT GET_ENT6
	if ( LOOP_COUNT == 7 ) local CHECK_ENT GET_ENT7
	if ( LOOP_COUNT == 8 ) local CHECK_ENT GET_ENT8
	if ( LOOP_COUNT == 9 ) local CHECK_ENT GET_ENT9

	if $get(CHECK_ENT,relationship,MY_OWNER) equals enemy
	
	if ( OWNER_ISPLAYER )
	{
		if game.pvp == 0
		if $get(CHECK_ENT,isplayer)
		local EXIT_SUB 1
	}
	if !EXIT_SUB

	applyeffect CHECK_ENT effects/effect_stun 5.0 0 1
}

//************************** GETPLAYERS <var> ***************************
getplayers <var>
JUN2007A
Stores all player targets, globally, in a tokenized string.
These can be pulled into indivudal vars via $get_token like so:

{ some_event
	getplayers TEST_PLAYERS
	setvard LOOP_COUNT 0
	calleventloop $get_token_amt(TEST_PLAYERS) list_players
}

{ list_players
	local CUR_PLAYER $get_token(TEST_PLAYERS,LOOP_COUNT)
	consolemsg ent_currentplayer Player # LOOP_COUNT - $get(CUR_PLAYER,name) alv $get(CUR_PLAYER,alive)
	add LOOP_COUNT 1
}

Each player token is about 12 characters long, so on a server with more than 20 players,
any script that uses this may "drop" players and thus be bugged. 
This due to the fact that strings are limited to 255 characters.
Shouldn't be an issue, as  generally servers run 8 players or less. 
(20 players would just dominate our monsters in addition to being unmanagable)


//************************** STRING PARSERS ***************************
$lcase(<string>) Returns lower case of <string> for more dependable comparison (APR2007a)
$left(<string>,<num>) Returns first <num> characters of <string> (MAY2007a)
(other string handler enhancements will be placed here)

//************************** playmp3 ***************************
(MAY2007a)
playmp3 <target|all> <minutes> <file> [range]
plays an mp3 or midi file on client(s), minutes maybe decimal
[range] plays music only on those within range of calling script
will be ignored by clients standing inside msarea_music brushes
