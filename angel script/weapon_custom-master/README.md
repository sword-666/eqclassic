# weapon_custom

The goal of the project is to allow mappers with no scripting experience to make cool new weapons, or just tweak the existing ones. There are 9 entities and hundreds of keyvalues to learn, so you may want to start with a tutorial or experiment with the example map.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/wootguy/weapon_custom/wiki) for tutorials and entity references.
