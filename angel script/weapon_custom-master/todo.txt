Questions:

1) Detect current skill level?
2) Do monster bullets have a skill setting?
3) Detect weapon slot is free or not?
4) Green HUD ammo bars always empty?

TODO:
killing yourself against a wall doesn't stop looping sounds (egon)
egon beams are disappearing sometimes. WHY???
tripmine deplete not fast enough
finish user beams

Nice to have features:
combine shoot ents for ultimate whatsits
trigger shoot entities on their own
think function for non-custom projectiles, so that they can use more of the options
kingpin orb projectile
projectile trigger on fire with projectile as activator
muzzle particles
dont fire on miss/damage for beams
projectiles disppear too early sometimes
options for takedamage instead of traceattack (hornet)
friendly fire option
water splash options?
projectile acceleration + max speed + easing + max speed time
multiple cooldown values for funky beats
fire secondary/tertiary at the same time?
Set keyvalue of target/trigger on impact
shoot during windup (gets faster and faster)
bullet accuracy affected by movement (BulletAccuracy())
EF_BRIGHTLIGHT for projectiles
flashbang effect (blind whoever looks)
penetration power
regenerate ammo if another gun with same ammo type is not also regening
parse material texture sounds for crowbar

DOCS:
explain damage types

Fixable Bugs:
Projectiles w/ Hull size > 0 do weird things when colliding with enemies (blood sprites 50 feet away from impact)
Projectiles sometimes get stuck inside enemies when set to bounce
Hammer sometimes won't save a float value if its set to "0". Do "0.0" isntead. (projectile defaults)

Unfixable Bugs:
Ammo dropping doesn't work
Custom ammo can't be picked up if no gun uses it (results in console errors)

INACCURACIES:
Crowbar:
- No footstep sounds on impact with world
- No electric mode
- Throw sound doesn't loop fast enough
- Cooldown for hitting flesh is slightly faster (0.25 vs 0.3). I think it's better this way.

Wrench:
- Decal isn't delayed. No point in doing this since it isn't also delayed for hitting monsters
- Windup power increases faster, then eases out at the end. This makes more sense I think
- Repairable breakables play damage sound when repaired

Medkit:
- Revive hitbox isn't quite the same

Barnacle:
- Can't overpower super strong gravity
- Can pull downwards

Uzi:
- No dual wield

M16:
- No secondary reload

Guass:
- Charge up speed isn't quite the same
- Doesn't shoot through glass, or kill you randomly when trying to do that.

Egon:
- The impact sprite is less laggy

Hornet:
- Secondary only fires yellow hornets

Tripmine:
- The weapon doesn't get removed fast enough when you use the last one
- World model doesn't work because there is none (SC uses v_model with body=3).

Shock Rifle:
- Secondary fire only has one beam and it doesn't chain between enemies
- Doesn't explode when dropped or out of ammo

Minigun:
- Windup functions are more responsive
